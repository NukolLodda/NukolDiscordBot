Bigoted Love
Charlie and Ethan
Boy’s Love 18+
Written by NukolLodda

   A homoerotic fiction about the love between two men based on Nukol’s actual classmates. The names of the characters of the story are the names of the aforementioned people albeit with their names altered. The premise, of course, to Nukol and his classmates is that the people the story is based on are homophobic, which adds irony to this story both as a joke about them but also because they are homophobic so of course they deserve a homoerotic fiction to get written about them. Joking aside, it provides a very intriguing overall idea for a storyline that you, the reader, might enjoy.
