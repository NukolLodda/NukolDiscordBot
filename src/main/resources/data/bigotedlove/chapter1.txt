Chapter 1: The Bump

Ethan is 17-year-old boy attending a high school and while his day goes on as usual, he bumps into one of his friends named Charlie, who typically enjoys hanging out in the garage. However, unbeknownst to Ethan, Charlie had broken up and began developing feelings for him. The two boys shared the same US history room last year and would often talk to each other, provided there is time.  They were best of friends, both enjoyed similar memes, videos, and sports activities, and the two would often joke to each other on account of their similar interests. As typical, Ethan acted as an impulsive child despite owning a truck while Charlie was a mediator of sorts for him. And when the bumped into each other, Charlie could not help but wonder, "could our relationship go beyond, that of just 'friends'?".

On the night prior to the day they bumped, Ethan had a dream about boning Charlie on top some rough leaves. The dream caused him to jizz all over his bed and the morning he woke up, he felt a sense of stickiness enveloping his body. Though as he typically goes, his mind wondered off pretty much immediately, and since then never gave it a thought. Until they bumped of course.
"Oh Sorry Charlie", said Ethan, "I didn't see you there".
Deep down, Charlie wanted to express his sensation of love towards Ethan, but he fears rejection may happen as a result.
"Oh it was ok", said Charlie.
He of course thought to himself, "well that came out wrong".

He hoped today would be the fateful day that he could ask him out. But the butterflies in his stomach grew into wasps and he could feel his ears spinning even at the thought of asking him out. Simply put, Charlie just couldn't, he lacked the courage to do so. After all, he thought that since Ethan was one of his best friends, that asking him out will ruin their relationship.

Ethan was of course, much more extraverted, and he tapped on to Charlie, then standing into his typical T-pose as a joke, and then said, "imageine balls".

It was this randomness the Charlie found so very endearing, and he thought for a sec "fuck it, it's now or never".

"Ethan, I would like to ask you to have dinner next week", said Charlie
